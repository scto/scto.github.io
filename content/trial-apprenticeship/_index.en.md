## The best machines for spray cans worldwide

![Testing an aerosol filling machine](images/pamasol-employee-tests-machine.en.jpg)

Are you interested in the profession of an **automation engineer**? Go ahead, sign up for a trial apprenticeship and you'll get a first-hand experience of the fascinating world of engineering - starting with **mechanical processing** and assembly, through **wiring** of electrical components all the way to **pneumatic controls** and **software engineering**.

The upper picture shows a Pamasol employee testing a **Macromat LB20**. This is a filling and sealing machine for spray cans. While the polymechanics and metal workers are working on the mechanic and metalwork, the **automation engineer** mounts all the electrical components such as **sensors, motors** and the big **touchscreen**. Afterwards, the **PLC** (that's the computer and thus the brain of the machine) gets **programmed** to bring life to the machine.

As soon as the machine is running and the customer finished his checklist, it will be shipped to the production site, for example Australia, the US or Brasil, but also Germany or Switzerland. Pamasol machines are located **all around the world**, producing billions of spray cans.

Fully trained automation engineers have the opportunity to visit different **countries and cultures**, because the machines scattered around the world are installed and serviced by Pamasol employees on site.

You probably haven't noticed it, but you definitely had a spray can in your hand that was filled on a Pamasol machine (deodorant, color spray, oven cleaner, shaving cream, room spray, silicone spray, oil spray, ...the list goes on and on).

A few answers to frequently asked questions:

### Is an automation engineer a demanded profession?

Yes, automation engineers are **professions in high demand** and will continue to be in the future.

More and more tasks and operations are done by machines and robots. Automation engineers are needed to build the machines and program the software for it.

### How long does an apprenticeship take and where do I need to go to school?

The apprenticeship lasts **4 years**. During this time the apprentices will visit one to two days a week the [vocational school](https://www.bbzg.ch/) **in Arth-Goldau**. If you attend the **Federal Professional Baccalaureate** during the apprenticeship, the school visit consists of two days a week for the entire apprenticeship.

Additionally to the vocational school you will attend inter-company professional training in the training centre [Swissmechanic](https://sz.swissmechanic.ch/ausbildungszentrum) in Pfäffikon SZ. These trainings take a few weeks each.

### What kind of advanced training opportunities are there?

There are alot of advanced training opportunities, such as the Federal Diploma of Higher Education for the **automation specialist** or the Advanced Federal Diploma of Higher Education for the **Master in Switchgear and Automation**.  

The most wanted advanced trainings from Pamasol automation engineers so far are the **Technician** ([CHF - College of Higher Education](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/de/home/bildung/hbb/hoehere-fachschulen.html)) or the study for the title **Engineer** ([University of Applied Sciences](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/de/home/hs/hochschulen/kantonale-hochschulen/fh-ph/die-fachhochschulen-der-schweiz.html)).

If you completed the Federal Professional Baccalaureate, you can for example attend the [ost.ch](https://www.ost.ch/en/) in Rapperswil to study for the Engineer.

### How much do you earn as a fully trained automation engineer?
